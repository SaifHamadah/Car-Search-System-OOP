# Car Search System (Java OOP)

A Java OOP project that simulates a car search platform similar to OpenSooq.  
The system applies key Object-Oriented Programming principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.

## 🏎 Project Overview
This system allows users to search for a specific car for various purposes such as sales or rentals.  
The program models real-world vehicle relationships through a clear class hierarchy and object composition.

## 🧩 Object-Oriented Structure
- **Vehicle (Superclass)** – General attributes shared by all vehicles  
- **Car (Subclass)** – A specific type of vehicle  
- **Sedan & SUV (Subclasses)** – Different shapes/types of cars, inheriting from Car  
- **Engine (Composition)** – Each car *has* an engine object representing its power and specifications  

## 🔍 System Functionality
Users can:
- Choose the type of vehicle  
- Select the car category (Sedan/SUV)  
- Set engine specifications  
- Filter and find a car based on the selected criteria  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Composition  

## 📌 Purpose
This project demonstrates how the same system scenario can be implemented using OOP principles, useful for learning, teaching, or demonstrating Java programming skills
